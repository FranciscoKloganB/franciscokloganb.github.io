# francisco_barros_curriculum_vitae:website

I no longer use this website to promote my curriculum vitae ever since I ignored GDPR e-mails from the free webhost I was using which eventually led to the shutdown of my domain.

This website still had somethings to be done, including, double language presentation and do better animations for my skillset on mobile

I did it mainly to practise HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery after finishing the semester where I first learned this technologies.
