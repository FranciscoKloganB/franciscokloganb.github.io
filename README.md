# Francisco Barros - Professional Website

The existing repository contains a Bulma template designed by Jeremy Thomas. The model has been modified to fit my personal needs concerning self-presentation to potential employers and to fit the prerequisites of GitHub pages.

The templates can be seen at https://bulmatemplates.github.io/bulma-templates/.

I should add that Bulma is a powerfull CSS framework, which I personally use on my photography portfolio/shop platform that you can visit at www.claymemoirs.com; It is a great alternative to bootstrap.
